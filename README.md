This is a save editor for the PC and Switch versions of Devil May Cry 1. It can currently modify all the parameters seen on the screenshot.  

## Usage
Download the latest version of the Windows binaries here: https://github.com/joaovitorbf/dmcsaveeditor/releases/latest  
Extract everything to a folder and run the executable. You can pick your dmc1.sav file and the save slot you want to modify on the "Save File Picker" panel. Modify everything you want and save.  
Save before switching slots, or your changes will be lost.
